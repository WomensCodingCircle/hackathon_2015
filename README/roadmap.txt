def getNeuronNames():
	#contacts DVID
	return list of neurons
	
def processNeuronsRequest(request):
	return json data for svg creation
	
def getInputsOutputs(neuronID):
	#contacts DVID
	returns all inputs and outputs from one neuron
	
def getBodyIds(neuron/typeName):
	#contacts dvid
	returns list of ids corresponding to neuron or type name

def filterInputsOutputs(listOfNeurons, inputsOutputs):
	returns inputs and outputs that connect to neurons in listOfNeurons
	
def generateEdgeList(listOfNeurons):
	#uses filterInputsOutputs and getBodyIds to generate a list of connections for svg
	returns list of connections for svg

def combineOutputs(nodes, celltypes, edges, combinationType):
	combines nodes by cell type and calculates inputs and outputs base on combo type (mean, sum, etc.)
	returns nodes, edges 
	
We can revise the format of input and output as we go. We will probably need to add more 
functions, and you can break your functions down into subfunctions if you would like.

Only getNeuronNames, and processNeuronsRequest, should actually have routes to go to the website,
the rest are helper functions.

I got what data I could into DVID, but if we need something different we can adapt.
